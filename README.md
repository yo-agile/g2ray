> Automated VLESS proxy setup via GitHub Codespaces — works anywhere Codespaces is available.

## Warning

**Use a secondary GitHub account (not your main account)** when forking and running this project. Running proxy servers may trigger GitHub's automated security systems or account restrictions.

## Features

- **Fixed UUID** — consistent identity across all sessions (no hardcoded credentials)
- **Latest Xray** — automatically fetches the newest stable Xray-core release at build time
- **Multi-architecture** — supports amd64, arm64, and armv7
- **Traffic sniffing** — detects HTTP/TLS for smarter routing
- **BitTorrent blocking** — prevents accidental P2P traffic through the proxy
- **Health checks** — built-in Docker health monitoring
- **Custom UUID** — optionally set `VLESS_UUID` env var to use your own UUID

## Quick Start

1. Fork this repository (use a secondary account)
2. Click **Code** > **Codespaces** > **Create codespace on main**
3. Wait 2–5 minutes for setup to complete
4. Copy the VLESS link printed in the terminal

### Import the Link

Use the generated VLESS link in any compatible proxy client:

- [V2RayNG](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayNG) (Android)
- [V2RayN](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN) (Windows)
- [Netch](https://github.com/netchx/netch) (Windows — gaming/TUN mode)
- [Clash Meta](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/ClashMetaForAndroid) (Android)
- [Nekoray](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/nekoray) (Linux/Windows)

## Configuration

### Custom UUID

Set the `VLESS_UUID` environment variable in your Codespace to use a specific UUID instead of an auto-generated one:

```
VLESS_UUID=your-custom-uuid-here
```

### Xray Config

The proxy configuration is in `.devcontainer/config.json`. Key settings:

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Port | 443 | Inbound VLESS port |
| Protocol | VLESS | Proxy protocol |
| Transport | WebSocket | Stream transport type |
| Path | / | WebSocket path |
| Sniffing | enabled | HTTP/TLS traffic detection |

## Codespace Quota

GitHub provides **120 free core-hours/month**:

| Cores | Hours/Month |
|-------|-------------|
| 2 | 60 |
| 4 | 30 |
| 8 | 15 |

**Stop your Codespace when not in use** to conserve hours.

## Compatible Networks

Tested with Shecan (free plan). If these IPs are reachable from your network, the proxy should work:

- `94.130.13.19`

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Codespace fails to start | Delete it and create a new one |
| No VLESS link shown | Check the terminal output for errors |
| Connection timeout | Try a different datacenter or ISP |
| Port not accessible | Ensure port 443 is set to public visibility |
